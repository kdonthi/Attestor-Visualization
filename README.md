# **ETH 2.0 Stock Prediction**

## **Overview**

This is a project to create advanced analytics about the blockchain. I have created a program to create a histogram to measure a specific validator's performance against other validators ```Histogram.py``` with instructions in ```Histogram.md```) and a program to develop a model to predict Blockchain prices (```CryptocurrencyPricingAnalysis.py``` with instructions in ```CryptocurrencyPricingAnalysis.md```).
